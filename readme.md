We solve separable NMF problem under convex relaxation in the form of self-dictionary multiple measurement vectors (SD-MMV), using Frank-Wolfe algorithm.
The proposed method exhibits desirable identifiablity property even under noisy cases while only requiring a linear growth of memory complexity with respect to data size.
